# PowerPoint Slides Workflow

Academic PowerPoint presentation skill. Full lifecycle:
create â†’ compile â†’ review â†’ polish â†’ verify.

Execution model: The agent writes a PptxGenJS (Node.js) script, executes it, and verifies the `.pptx`.
Math formulas: OMML (native math, default) or LaTeX â†’ PNG/SVG pipeline (paragraph-mode fallback).

## 1. Hard Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Motivation before formalism** â€” every concept starts with "Why?" before "What?". Never drop a definition without context.
2. **Worked example within 2 slides** â€” every definition must have a concrete worked example within 2 slides of its introduction.
3. **Telegraphic style** â€” keyword phrases, not full sentences. Slides are speaker prompts, not manuscripts. Exception: one framing sentence per slide to set context.
4. **Every slide earns its place** â€” must contain at least one substantive element (formula, diagram, table, theorem, algorithm, chart). A slide with only 3 short bullets and nothing else must be merged or enriched.
5. **Max 2 accent cards per slide** â€” more dilutes emphasis. Accent cards are colored boxes, callout shapes, or highlighted regions. Demote lower-priority items to plain text.
6. **Reference slide** â€” the second-to-last slide (before Thank You) must list key cited works. Include the primary paper and 3-5 most relevant references.
7. **Color-blind safe palette** â€” blue+orange preferred, never red+green for binary contrasts. WCAG AA contrast ratio â‰¥ 4.5:1 for text on backgrounds. Semantic colors defined in theme.
8. **Font size hierarchy** â€” `F` constant object defines default baselines: cover 48pt, section 36pt, title bar 22pt, body 15pt, small 12pt, caption 11pt, cardTitle 18pt, tblHead 13pt, tblCell 12pt. Never go below 10pt. When a card or region has sparse content (text fills <50% of available area), scale up by 2-4pt in the QA fix pass.
9. **Backup slides** â€” 3-5 after Thank You, separated by an appendix divider slide. For anticipated questions: detailed proofs, extended comparisons, additional data.
10. **Verify after every task** â€” execute JS â†’ `soffice` â†’ PDF â†’ image inspection. No task is complete without visual verification.
11. **No AI-signature accent lines** â€” never place decorative lines directly under titles. This is a tell-tale of AI-generated slides and looks unprofessional.
12. **Layout diversity** â€” never use the same layout type for 3+ consecutive slides. Alternate among: full-width, two-column, formula-centered, stat-callout, icon-grid, timeline, table, chart, etc.
13. **Formula rendering** â€” OMML (native PowerPoint math) for display/inline formulas (default). PNG@600DPI or SVG for paragraph-mode formulas (fallback). Blurry image formulas unacceptable.
14. **16:9 layout, 0.5" margins** â€” `LAYOUT_16x9` (10" x 5.625"). Maintain 0.5" breathing room on all four sides. Content area: 9" x 4.625".
15. **Never reuse PptxGenJS option objects** â€” the library mutates objects in-place (e.g., converting shadow values to EMU). Always create fresh objects per call. Use factory functions: `const makeShadow = () => ({...})`.
16. **No # prefix on hex colors** â€” use `"FF0000"` not `"#FF0000"`. The `#` prefix corrupts the output file silently.
17. **Visual theme consistency** â€” the chosen palette applies globally: slide backgrounds, text colors, formula foreground, chart colors, accent card fills, divider lines. No off-theme colors.
18. **No Unicode math approximations** â€” never use Unicode subscripts (â‚€, â‚), superscripts (áµ–áµ‰), or special math symbols (âˆ‘, âˆ, âˆˆ, âˆ€, âˆ) as plain text inside cards or text boxes. All mathematical notation â€” including inline formulas, variable-with-subscript, Greek letters in equations â€” must be rendered via OMML (preferred) or the LaTeX image pipeline (for paragraph mode). For card bodies that mix text and math, use OMML placeholders for individual formulas or render the entire body as a single LaTeX image. The only exceptions: simple single Latin letters (x, y, n) and plain numbers without operators.
19. **Vertical content distribution** â€” content below the title bar must span â‰¥75% of `CH` vertically. If all elements end in the upper half, something is wrong: increase card heights, add spacing, scale up fonts, or add a summary/insight card at the bottom. Every content slide should feel "filled" â€” no large empty patches below the last element.
20. **Content density lower bounds** â€” a slide with â‰¤3 short text-only bullets (no formula, diagram, table, or card) is **too sparse** â€” merge with an adjacent slide or enrich with a visual element. Pure text-only slides should be â‰¤20% of the total deck. Each card must contain enough text to fill â‰¥40% of its interior area; if not, scale up font by 2-4pt or merge cards.
21. **Boundary validation** â€” every element must satisfy `y + h â‰¤ SH - M` (5.125"). During script generation, mentally verify each element's bottom edge before writing it. Common traps: stacking cards below a table without accounting for table rendered height; `addCardFormula` with a formula image taller than the card body area; two-row card layouts where the second row overshoots. When using `addCardFormula`, the formula height parameter `fH` must be â‰¤ `cardH - 0.75` (title area). If content cannot fit, reduce card height, shrink formula `targetH`, or split across two slides. The visual QA agent must specifically flag any element whose bottom edge is clipped by the slide boundary.
22. **Reference slide formatting** â€” strictly single-column layout. Divide `CH` equally among N references, each entry vertically centered in its row. Use `F.body.size` font (or `F.small.size` if many entries). No divider lines, no decorative elements â€” just evenly distributed text rows filling the page. If references exceed 8 per page, continue on a second reference slide. The reference slide must look evenly filled â€” no large blank patches at top or bottom.
23. **OMML post-processing & sizing** â€” after PptxGenJS generates the .pptx, run `inject_omml.py` to replace `{{MATH:id}}` placeholders with native OMML math. Verify zero residual `{{MATH:` placeholders in the output. OMML formulas display as blank or distorted in LibreOffice â€” this is expected and not a bug. Only check image formula clarity in visual QA. **CRITICAL OMML sizing rule**: OMML formulas render at the text box's font size and do NOT respect the text box height constraint â€” tall constructs like `\sqrt{}`, `\frac{}{}`, `\sum`, `\prod` will visually overflow the text box. To prevent overlap: (a) never place an OMML formula directly above or below a card/table with tight spacing â€” leave â‰¥0.15" extra vertical gap per level of nesting (fractions, roots, large operators); (b) for complex formulas with roots, fractions, or stacked operators, prefer image rendering (`"render": "image"` in formulas.json) which respects exact pixel dimensions; (c) when using `addMathText` with `F.body.size` (15pt), expect the rendered height to be ~0.4" for simple formulas but up to 0.7" for formulas with `\sqrt{}` or `\frac{}{}`; (d) when an OMML formula must appear between two elements, compute spacing as if the formula is 1.5â€“2Ã— the `targetH` parameter.
24. **Diagram engine selection** â€” Graphviz for structural/flow diagrams (architecture, dependency, comparison, tree). Mermaid for behavioral/temporal diagrams (sequence, state, Gantt, ER). TikZ only for math-intensive or paper-faithful reproductions. Don't use Graphviz for sequence diagrams, don't use Mermaid for complex node layouts.
25. **Diagram theme consistency** â€” all rendered diagrams must use the current theme's colors. Node fill = `cardFill` equivalent, borders = `ac.pos`, text = `tx.pri`. Graphviz/Mermaid default colors (blue/black) must never appear in final output. Pass `--theme` to `render_diagrams.py`.
27. **Text overflow prevention & padding** â€” PptxGenJS text boxes do NOT clip overflow â€” text that exceeds the box renders outside, overlapping elements below. **Three mandatory protections**: (a) `shrinkText: true` on ALL text boxes (maps to `<a:normAutofit/>`). **NEVER use `autoFit: true`** â€” it maps to `<a:spAutoFit/>` which expands the shape. (b) Card text uses `const px = x + 0.25, pw = w - 0.4` â€” giving 0.19" clear of accent bar and 0.15" from right edge. Title: `(px, y+0.1, pw, 0.4)`, body: `(px, y+0.48, pw, h-0.62)` with `margin: [2, 0, 8, 0]`. (c) **Vertical gap discipline**: every element placed below another must start â‰¥0.1" after the previous element's bottom. Use `gap()` helper to verify at script-generation time. Standalone `addText` calls between cards/formulas are the #1 source of overlap bugs â€” always compute y from the preceding element's known bottom, never approximate. **Content limit**: card body should have â‰¤4 short lines per inch of body height. If more text is needed, increase card height or split content.
28. **Figure attribution** â€” figures extracted from papers must include source attribution (`Source: Author et al., Year`) via `addFigure()` caption. Width <800px requires warning to user about projection blur. Never extract tables â€” rebuild with PptxGenJS `addTable()`.
29. **Visual-first planning** â€” audiences grasp structure through visual anchors, not bullet lists. During Phase 2, ask for each slide: "Can the audience understand this in 10 seconds from text alone?" If not, the slide needs a visual element (diagram, table, chart, or figure). Common signals: multi-step processes, component relationships, data comparisons, hierarchies, numerical trends â€” these almost always need visuals rather than prose. Phase 2 self-check: every section has â‰¥1 non-formula visual element; slides with zero visuals (no diagram, table, chart, or figure) must stay â‰¤30% of the deck.
30. **Table cell formulas** â€” math notation inside table cells (`O(n)`, `Îµ`, `âˆ‘_{i}`, etc.) must use OMML placeholders (`{{MATH:id}}`), never Unicode approximations or plain text. Add each cell formula to `formulas.json` with `"render": "omml"`. OMML inherits the cell's font size (`F.tblCell.size` = 12pt) automatically. For complex constructs (fractions, large operators, stacked expressions) that would overflow cell height, use image rendering (`"render": "image"`) with `targetH` â‰¤ `rowH - 0.08`. Pass cell objects to `addTable` for OMML cells: `{text: "{{MATH:f42}}", options: {}}`.
31. **Long table pagination** â€” tables exceeding the per-slide row limit (8-10 data rows) must be split across slides. Each continuation slide repeats the header row and appends " (cont'd)" to the slide title via `addTableCont()`. Split at logical row group boundaries (e.g., between algorithm families, metric categories, dataset groups) â€” never mid-group. The last page should have â‰¥3 data rows; if fewer, merge with the previous page. Each page gets its own caption/takeaway if the subset tells a different story.
32. **Figure aspect-ratio-aware layout** â€” when embedding extracted paper figures, choose layout based on the figure's width/height ratio (from manifest metadata or measured dimensions): ratio > 1.6 (wide) â†’ full-width centered via `addFigure()`. Ratio â‰¤ 1.6 (normal/tall) â†’ figure-left + text-right via `addFigureWithText()`. Never stretch or crop figures to fit â€” always preserve original aspect ratio. Compute `figRatio` from manifest: `width_px / height_px` (PNG) or `width_pt / height_pt` (SVG). Cap figure width at 60% of CW in side-by-side layout to leave room for explanation bullets.
33. **Alignment consistency** â€” elements of the same type on the same slide (e.g., multiple cards, multiple bullets, multiple formulas) should share identical x-coordinates and consistent widths. Tolerance: â‰¤0.05" deviation. The `check_overlaps.py` alignment check (run in Phase 5) flags misalignment. Common violations: card columns with slightly different x-offsets, formula images that aren't centered on the same axis, bullet lists at inconsistent left margins. When using `cols2()` or manual column positioning, always derive x from the same constant â€” never approximate.
34. **Speaker notes (optional)** â€” if the user requests speaker notes or the presentation is for a talk where notes would help (e.g., journal club, defense), generate notes per slide via `addNotes(slide, text)`. Notes should be telegraphic talking points (3-5 per slide), not full scripts. Include: key message, transition to next slide, potential audience questions. Notes are embedded in the .pptx Notes pane â€” visible in Presenter View. This is opt-in: only generate when user explicitly requests or when asked during Phase 1.

## 2. Color Themes & Visual System

5 themes: **Academic Light** (default), **Midnight**, **Ocean**, **Forest**, **Sandwich**.

**Read `references/themes.md`** for full theme JSON blocks, slide master definitions, typography table, semantic colors, script template, and scoring rubric. These are needed in Phase 4 (script generation) and Phase 5 (QA scoring).

Key points (always in context):
- 4 slide masters per theme: `TITLE_SLIDE`, `SECTION_SLIDE`, `CONTENT_SLIDE`, `THANK_YOU`
- Typography: Georgia (titles) + Calibri (body)
- Semantic colors: positive=`0173B2`, negative=`DE8F05`, emphasis=`029E73`, neutral=`8C8C8C`
- Sandwich theme has dual formula colors (light bg + dark bg variants)

### 2.1 Layout Type Pool

|--------|----------|
| `title` | Cover slide |
| `section-divider` | Chapter transition |
| `text-left-image-right` | Concept + illustration (55/45 split) |
| `two-column` | Comparison / parallel content |
| `formula-centered` | Formula-dominant slide |
| `formula-with-annotation` | Formula + side annotations |
| `stat-callout` | Big number / key conclusion |
| `icon-grid` | Multiple points with colored shapes |
| `timeline` | Process / history flow |

| `table-with-insight` | Table + key finding card below |
| `table-continuation` | Long table split page with " (cont'd)" |
| `chart` | Chart/graph display |
| `text-left-diagram-right` | Text + diagram side-by-side (55/45 split) |
| `full-diagram` | Full-width diagram |
| `chart-centered` | Chart + caption |
| `figure-with-text` | Extracted figure + explanation bullets (aspect-ratio-aware) |

## 3. Actions

### 3.1 `create [topic]` â€” Full Pipeline (Phase 0-5)

Collaborative, iterative presentation creation. **Strict phase gates â€” never skip ahead.**

#### Phase 0: Material Analysis

**Read first, ask later.** Must understand the content before asking meaningful questions.

- Read the full paper/materials thoroughly
- Extract: core contributions, key techniques, main theorems, comparison with prior work
- Map notation conventions
- Identify logical structure and slide-worthy sections
- Note: prerequisite knowledge, natural section boundaries, what could be skipped or expanded

**Do NOT present results or ask questions yet â€” proceed directly to Phase 1.**

#### Phase 1: Requirements Interview (MANDATORY)

Conduct a content-driven interview with the available user-input mechanism. Questions are informed by Phase 0 analysis.

**Required questions** (always ask):
1. **Duration** â€” How long is the presentation?
2. **Audience level** â€” Who are the listeners? (experts, graduate students, general academic)
3. **Prerequisites** â€” List concrete technical dependencies from Phase 0. Ask which the audience knows.
4. **Content scope** â€” Offer the paper's actual components as options. Which to emphasize, skip, or briefly mention?
5. **Depth vs breadth** â€” If the paper has both overview and detailed constructions, ask preference.
6. **Visual style** â€” Which theme?
   - A) Academic Light â€” white/light gray, clean and precise (default)
   - B) Midnight â€” dark throughout, tech/premium feel
   - C) Ocean â€” blue tones, professional academic
   - D) Forest â€” green natural tones
   - E) Sandwich â€” dark title/conclusion + light content
7. **Speaker notes** (optional) â€” Would you like speaker notes in the Presenter View pane? Useful for journal clubs, defenses, or rehearsing. If yes, notes will be generated as telegraphic talking points per slide.

**Slide count heuristic** (~1 slide per 1.5-2 minutes):

| Duration | Total slides | Intro/Motivation | Methods/Background | Core content | Summary |
|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| 5min (lightning) | 5-7 | 1-2 | 0-1 | 2-3 | 1 |
| 10min (short) | 8-12 | 2 | 1-2 | 4-5 | 1 |
| 15min (conference) | 10-15 | 2-3 | 2-3 | 5-7 | 1-2 |
| 20min (seminar) | 13-18 | 3 | 2-3 | 6-9 | 2 |
| 45min (keynote) | 22-30 | 4-5 | 5-7 | 10-14 | 2-3 |
| 90min (lecture) | 45-60 | 5-6 | 8-12 | 25-35 | 3-4 |

**Talk-type tips** â€” different formats demand different strategies. Misjudging the format is the #1 cause of bad presentations:

| Talk type | Key emphasis | Common mistake |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Lightning (5min) | One core message, no background | Cramming a full talk into 5 minutes |
| Conference (10-20min) | 1-2 key results, fast methods overview | Too much technical detail, no big picture |
| Seminar (45min) | Deep dive OK, but need visual rhythm | Wall-to-wall formulas without examples |
| Defense/Thesis | Demonstrate mastery, systematic coverage | Skipping motivation, rushing results |
| Journal club | Critical analysis, facilitate discussion | Summarizing without evaluating |
| Grant pitch | Significance â†’ feasibility â†’ impact | Too technical, not enough "why it matters" |

**Pacing principle**: spend 40-50% of time on core content (results/techniques). Max 3-4 consecutive theory-heavy slides before a worked example or visual break â€” audiences disengage after ~5 minutes of uninterrupted formalism.

#### Phase 2: Structure Plan (GATE â€” user must approve)

Detailed outline per section:
- Section title
- Allocated slide count
- Key content points per slide (1-2 lines)
- **Layout type** for each slide (from layout pool in Section 2.4)
- Planned diagrams/charts (brief description)
- Notation to be introduced

**Phase 2 self-check before presenting:**
- Each section has â‰¥1 non-formula visual element (diagram, table, chart, or figure)
- Slides with zero visuals â‰¤30% of deck (R29)
- Every multi-step process, component relationship, or data comparison has a planned visual â€” not just bullets

**Present the plan. Ask: structure OK? User must approve before proceeding.**

#### Phase 3: Formula Preparation

1. Scan Phase 2 structure, collect all formulas into a list. **Include table cell math** (R30): scan every planned table for cells containing subscripts, Greek letters, operators, or complexity notation â€” each becomes a separate `formulas.json` entry with `"render": "omml"`.
2. Write `formulas.json` with `render` field (`"omml"` | `"image"` | `"auto"`; default `"auto"` â†’ paragraphâ†’image, elseâ†’omml):
   ```json
   [
     {"id": "f01-entropy", "latex": "H(X) = -\\sum_{x} p(x) \\log p(x)", "mode": "display"},
     {"id": "p01-body", "latex": "\\begin{minipage}{8cm}...", "mode": "paragraph", "fg_color": "1A1A2E"}
   ]
   ```
3. Run renderer (only renders image entries; omml entries get manifest metadata only):
   ```bash
   python <skill-dir>/scripts/render_latex.py formulas.json formulas/
   ```
4. Check `formulas/manifest.json` for errors. Fix LaTeX or fall back to plain text.

**Sandwich theme**: OMML formulas inherit text color automatically â€” no dual rendering needed. Only **image-rendered** formulas (paragraph mode) need two variants:
```json
[
  {"id": "p01-light", "latex": "...", "fg_color": "2D3436", "mode": "paragraph"},
  {"id": "p01-dark",  "latex": "...", "fg_color": "FFFFFF", "mode": "paragraph"}
]
```

**Math-heavy paragraphs** (MANDATORY â€” Hard Rule 18): scan every card body and text box planned in Phase 2. If ANY of these appear, the text MUST be rendered as a LaTeX image (not Unicode approximations):
- Subscripts or superscripts (x_i, e^{ax}, H_0)
- Greek letters in equations (Î±, Î², Î£, âˆ)
- Operators with operands (âˆˆ, âŠ†, âˆ, â‰¥)
- Fractions, summations, products, integrals

For isolated formulas (display/inline): use OMML (default `render:"auto"` handles this). For card bodies with mixed text+math: render the entire paragraph as a single LaTeX image using `\text{}` for non-math words â€” add to `formulas.json` with `"mode": "paragraph"` (auto-routes to image). In Phase 4, embed via `addFormula()` / `addCardFormula()` â€” helpers auto-route based on manifest.

**Error recovery**: if `render_latex.py` reports errors in manifest (`"error": "..."`), fix the LaTeX source, re-run. Fallback: render as plain text in PptxGenJS.

**Security note**: render LaTeX and TikZ only from trusted generated content or reviewed user material. Do not run the renderer on unreviewed third-party snippets; use an isolated temporary workspace for any content that did not originate in the current task.

**Phase 3-4 iteration**: if Phase 4 discovers additional formulas needed, append to `formulas.json` and re-run incrementally.

#### Phase 3.5: Diagram Preparation

1. Scan Phase 2 structure, identify diagrams and visual elements that need rendering.
2. Classify each into the 5-layer pipeline:
   - **graphviz** â€” architecture, flow, dependency, neural network, tree, comparison diagrams (DOT language)
   - **mermaid** â€” sequence, Gantt, pie, state, ER diagrams
   - **tikz** â€” math-intensive, geometric constructions, paper-faithful reproductions
   - **shapes** â€” simple annotations, arrows, highlights (PptxGenJS native â€” handle in Phase 4, not here)
   - **extract** â€” figures from paper PDFs (extract-figures workflow)
3. Write `diagrams.json` (see `diagram-rendering.md` for schema).
4. **MCP pre-extraction** (for `type: "extract"` entries without `crop`):
   For each such entry, try MCP extraction before running the batch renderer:
   ```
   mcp__pdf-mcp__pdf_extract_images(path=SOURCE_PDF, pages=PAGE, output_dir="diagrams")
   ```
   - Images saved directly to `diagrams/` as PNG files (original resolution, zero token cost).
   - From returned metadata, pick the largest on the target page (max `width * height`).
   - Rename to match diagram ID: `mv diagrams/page3_img0.png diagrams/<id>.png`
   - If MCP returns no images or fails â†’ leave for `render_diagrams.py` fallback.
   - Entries with `crop` always skip MCP (page-region extraction needs pdftoppm).
   - The batch renderer auto-skips IDs whose `.png` already exists on disk.
5. Run the renderer:
   ```bash
   python <skill-dir>/scripts/render_diagrams.py diagrams.json diagrams/ --theme <theme_name>
   ```
6. Check `diagrams/manifest.json` for errors. Fix DOT/Mermaid syntax or degrade to PptxGenJS shapes.

**DOT writing guide:** max ~15 nodes, `rankdir=LR` for horizontal flows / `rankdir=TB` for vertical hierarchies, `subgraph cluster_*` for grouping.

**Mermaid guide:** actor/participant â‰¤6, supported types: `sequenceDiagram`, `gantt`, `pie`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`.

**Read `diagram-rendering.md`** for full 5-layer architecture docs, `diagrams.json` schema, theme color mapping, and troubleshooting.

**Security note**: `render_diagrams.py` allowlists Graphviz engines (`dot`, `neato`, `fdp`, `circo`). Treat Mermaid/TikZ/DOT as trusted generated content or reviewed user material before rendering.

#### Phase 4: Generate JS Script + Execute

Write a complete PptxGenJS script. Run a dependency preflight first; do not install packages implicitly during the workflow:
```bash
node -e "require.resolve('pptxgenjs')"
```
If this preflight fails, stop and use the project's documented setup path or get explicit approval before installing dependencies.

**Read `references/themes.md` â†’ "Script Template" section** for the full starter template with theme constants (`T`), typography constants (`F`), layout constants (`SW`/`SH`/`M`/`CW`/`CY`/`CH`), slide masters, `addFormula()` helper, diagram helpers (`addDiagram`, `addDiagramAt`, `addFigure`), chart helper (`addChart`), and semantic helpers (`sTitle`, `sectionSlide`, `addBullets`, `addCard`, `addTable`, `addNumCard`, `addFlow`, `cols2`). Also read `pptxgenjs-reference.md` â†’ "Layout Code Patterns" for 9 ready-to-use code blocks (including diagram and chart layouts), `formula-rendering.md` for the LaTeX pipeline, and `diagram-rendering.md` for the diagram pipeline.

**Use `F` object for all font sizes**, `cols2()` for two-column layouts, and helper functions for common patterns. Never hardcode font sizes â€” always reference `F.body.size`, `F.title.size`, etc.

**User-provided images** (logos, photos, screenshots): embed directly via `slide.addImage({ path: "image.png", ... })`. Calculate aspect ratio from original dimensions. Center with `x: (SW - w) / 2`. No special pipeline needed â€” just verify the file exists.

**Key rules for script generation:**
- Always use factory functions for shadows, fills, and other option objects
- Never use `#` prefix on hex colors
- Use `breakLine: true` between text array items
- Use `bullet: true` for list items, never unicode "â€¢"
- Set `margin: 0` on text boxes that need precise alignment with shapes
- For `icon-grid` layout: use simple colored rectangles/circles as visual markers (shapes, not icon images)

##### 4a. Mathematical Slide Patterns

Math-heavy slides should follow one of these structural templates â€” they prevent the common trap of dumping a formula with no context:

**Definition slide:**
```
[Framing sentence: why this definition matters]
[Formal definition â€” display formula or card]
[Key properties / immediate consequences â€” 2-3 bullet items]
```

**Construction/Algorithm slide:**
```
[One-line goal statement]
[Core equation / algorithm steps]
[Complexity or performance: prover cost, verifier cost, soundness]
```

**Comparison slide:**
```
[Side-by-side table or two-column: prior work vs this work]
[1-2 lines highlighting the key difference]
```

**Theorem â†’ Proof slide (two slides, never one):**
```
Slide A: [Informal statement] â†’ [Formal theorem in card] â†’ [Why it matters]
Slide B: [Proof sketch â€” key steps only, â‰¤5 lines. Full proof in backup.]
```

**Insight/Remark slide:**
```
[Observation the paper doesn't emphasize, or connection to related work]
[Why this matters / what it implies]
```

Every math slide must have a clear **takeaway** â€” the one thing the audience should remember from that slide.

##### 4b. Content Density Upper Bounds

Lower bounds are in R4/R20. Upper bounds prevent cognitive overload â€” a slide with too much is worse than one with too little, because the audience retains nothing:

- â‰¤ 7 bullet points or items per slide
- â‰¤ 2 displayed formulas per slide (more â†’ split across slides)
- â‰¤ 5 new symbols introduced per slide
- â‰¤ 2 accent cards per slide (R5 already covers this)

**Density self-check after each batch:**
- Count slides with zero formulas/diagrams/tables â†’ flag if >30% of batch
- Count slides with â‰¤3 short items and no math â†’ candidates for merging
- Count slides exceeding upper bounds â†’ split or redistribute

##### 4c. Table Best Practices

**Layout & alignment:**
- Column alignment: numbers right-aligned, text left-aligned, short labels centered
- Max 6-7 columns, 8-10 data rows per slide. More â†’ split across slides (R31) or highlight a subset
- Numeric precision: align decimal points within a column; use consistent significant digits (e.g., all "XX.X%" or all "X.XX"); thousands separator optional but must be consistent

**Cell content:**
- Math in cells must use OMML (R30) â€” scan every cell for subscripts, Greek letters, operators, complexity notation. Add each to `formulas.json` with `"render": "omml"`. Pass `{text: "{{MATH:id}}", options: {}}` to `addTable`
- For cells mixing text and math (e.g., "achieves {{MATH:f12}} speedup"), use a single OMML placeholder wrapping the math portion â€” `inject_omml.py` handles mixed runs
- Merged cells: use `colspan`/`rowspan` in cell options for grouped headers (e.g., "Complexity" spanning "Time" and "Space" columns). Keep merge depth â‰¤2 levels â€” deeper nesting harms readability

**Highlighting & emphasis:**
- Highlight key cells with bold or `ac.pos` color â€” draw the eye to the result
- For comparison tables: bold the best result in each row/column
- Use striped rows (via `addTable` helper) for readability in tables with >5 rows

**Long table pagination (R31):**
- Tables with >8-10 data rows â†’ split across slides using `addTableCont()`
- Each continuation slide repeats the full header row and marks the title with " (cont'd)"
- Split at logical group boundaries; last page must have â‰¥3 data rows
- Each page gets its own caption/takeaway if the subset tells a different story

**Table + insight combo:**
- Prefer a two-section layout: table in the upper 60%, insight card or key-finding bullets in the lower 40%
- Never leave a table without a takeaway â€” at minimum a `F.small.size` caption line below
- For "paper Table 1" reproductions: first the faithful table, then a separate insight slide highlighting the 2-3 most important rows/cells with explanation

##### 4d. Algorithm and Code Display

- Pseudocode â‰¤ 10 lines per slide. If longer, split into "high-level overview" and "key subroutine" slides
- Highlight the critical line(s) with `ac.pos` background color
- Input/output clearly stated at the top
- Variables in italic, functions in regular weight â€” consistent naming throughout
- For actual code (not pseudocode): use monospace font, show only the relevant fragment â€” never dump an entire source file

**Batching**: if >20 slides, write script in batches of 8-10 slides. Self-check density and layout diversity per batch. Final script is one file executed once.

**Opening strategies** (pick one):
- Provocative question the audience cannot immediately answer
- Surprising statistic that challenges assumptions
- Real-world failure/problem â†’ "How do we solve this?"
- Visual demonstration â€” show the phenomenon before explaining it

**Closing strategies**:
- Callback to opening â€” revisit the opening question, now answered
- 3 key takeaways â€” numbered, telegraphic, one slide
- Future direction â€” open question that invites Q&A
- **Never end on a bare "Thank You"** â€” the second-to-last content slide is the lasting impression

##### 4e. Script Self-Review (before execution)

Re-read the completed JS script and verify before running `node`. Catching issues here avoids wasting a QA round:

*Structure:*
- [ ] Slide count matches Phase 2 plan (Â±2 tolerance)
- [ ] Logical flow: motivation â†’ background â†’ technique â†’ results â†’ summary
- [ ] No section has >4 consecutive formula-heavy slides without a worked example or visual break
- [ ] Section divider slides present between major sections

*Content density:*
- [ ] No slide has only â‰¤3 short bullets with no math/diagram/table
- [ ] No slide exceeds upper bounds (7 bullets, 2 formulas, 5 new symbols, 2 accent cards)
- [ ] Pure text-only slides â‰¤ 20% of deck

*Layout & positioning:*
- [ ] Every element satisfies `y + h â‰¤ SH - M` (R21)
- [ ] `shrinkText: true` on all multi-line text boxes (R27)
- [ ] No same layout type for 3+ consecutive slides (R12)
- [ ] `F` constants used for all font sizes â€” no hardcoded numbers

*Notation:*
- [ ] Same symbol used consistently throughout all slides
- [ ] Every symbol defined before first use

#### Phase 5: QA Loop (MANDATORY)

```
â”Œâ”€â†’ 5a. Execute JS script â†’ .pptx
â”‚   5b. soffice â†’ PDF â†’ pdftoppm â†’ slide images
â”‚   5c. Subagent visual inspection (per-slide)
â”‚   5d. markitdown text extraction â†’ content verification
â”‚   5e. Score (apply rubric)
â”‚   5f. Fix (edit JS and/or re-render formulas â†’ re-execute)
â””â”€â”€ score < 90 AND round < 3: loop back to 5a
    score â‰¥ 90 OR round = 3: report to user
```

**5a. Execute + OMML injection**:
```bash
node generate_slides.js
# If manifest has any render:"omml" entries, inject OMML math:
python <skill-dir>/scripts/inject_omml.py output.pptx formulas.json output.pptx
```

**5b. Convert to images**:
```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir . output.pptx
pdftoppm -png -r 200 output.pdf /tmp/slide
```

**Quick thumbnail grid** (optional â€” for rapid overview before detailed inspection):
```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/thumbnail.py output.pptx thumbnails --cols 4
```

**5c. Visual inspection** (via parallel subagents):

Slide images at 200 DPI are ~1-2MB each. Reading images accumulates in context â€” reading more than ~7 images in the main conversation or a single agent will exceed the 20MB limit. **NEVER read slide images directly in the main conversation.**

**Strategy**: dispatch parallel subagents, each assigned 3-5 slides. Each agent reads its slides one at a time, inspects them, and returns a **text-only** report. The main conversation only receives text, keeping context clean.

```
Total slides: N
Agents: ceil(N/5) agents, each reading up to 5 consecutive slide images
All agents run in parallel
```

Each agent prompt:
> "Read slide images [start]-[end] from /tmp/slide-{NN}.png, ONE image per Read call.
> For each slide check: overflow, overlap, font legibility, formula clarity, contrast,
> layout clutter, content density, bottom-edge clipping.
>
> **CRITICAL â€” content density measurement**: judge blank space by the RENDERED PIXELS
> in the slide image, NOT by assumed text box boundaries. A text box can be 3" tall but
> render only 2 lines of text occupying 0.5" â€” that is 2.5" of visual blank space.
> Look at the actual slide image: where does visible content (text, shapes, images, formulas)
> END vertically? The gap from there to the slide bottom is the true blank space.
> Flag if visible content occupies <75% of the area below the title bar (R19).
>
> **CRITICAL â€” bottom-edge overflow (R21)**: check if any card, table, formula, or text
> is clipped at the slide bottom edge. Signs: text cut mid-line, card shadow missing
> at bottom, table rows disappearing. This is the #1 most common layout bug.
> Also check if a card title overlaps with its body content (title text running into
> body text below it â€” usually caused by long wrapped titles at large font sizes).
>
> **Diagram check**: labels readable, edges distinguishable, no node overlap,
> colors match slide theme (no Graphviz default blue/black), diagram fits
> within content area without cropping. Extracted figures have source caption.
>
> **OMML note**: OMML formulas display as blank in LibreOffice/PDF preview.
> This is a known limitation, not a bug. Only check image formula clarity.
>
> Return a TEXT report only â€” list issues by slide number + description + severity.
> If no issues found for a slide, report 'OK'."

Merge all agent reports into a single issues list.

**5a-post. XML validation** (after OMML injection): verify no residual `{{MATH:` placeholders:
```bash
python -c "
import zipfile, sys
with zipfile.ZipFile('output.pptx') as z:
    for n in z.namelist():
        if n.startswith('ppt/slides/') and n.endswith('.xml'):
            if b'{{MATH:' in z.read(n):
                print(f'RESIDUAL PLACEHOLDER in {n}'); sys.exit(1)
print('OK: no residual placeholders')
"
```

**5a-post2. Overlap & boundary check** (after OMML injection):
```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/check_overlaps.py output.pptx
```
If exit code is non-zero (critical/major issues found), fix the JS script and re-run.
The checker is card-aware: it groups card internals (container rect + accent bar + title + body)
to avoid false positives. It detects: element overlaps, bottom-edge overflow, and tight gaps.

**5d. Content verification**:
```bash
markitdown output.pptx > content.md
```
Read `content.md` to verify text content, notation consistency, spelling.

**5e. Quality Scoring**: Apply rubric from `references/themes.md` â†’ "Quality Scoring Rubric". Thresholds: â‰¥90 deliver, 80-89 warnings, <80 must fix.

**5f. Fix**: edit JS script to fix issues. Re-render formulas if color/DPI problems. Re-execute and re-score. Max 3 rounds.

### 3.2 `compile [file.js]`

Execute an existing PptxGenJS script to generate .pptx.

```bash
node -e "require.resolve('pptxgenjs')"
node FILE.js
```

Post-compile checks:
- Exit code 0?
- Output .pptx file exists?
- File size reasonable? (>10KB = has content, <50MB = reasonable)
- Report: output path, file size, success/failure

---

### 3.3 `review [file.pptx]`

Read-only proofreading report. No file edits.

Extract text:
```bash
markitdown FILE.pptx > content.md
```

**4 check categories:**

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| Grammar | Subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions, tense consistency |
| Typos | Spelling errors, search-replace artifacts, duplicate words, unreplaced placeholders (`[name]`, `[TODO]`) |
| Consistency | Citation format, notation, terminology, color usage across slides |
| Academic quality | Informal contractions, unsupported claims, ambiguous abbreviations |

**Report format per issue:**
```
### Issue N: [Brief description]
- **Location:** [slide number or title]
- **Current:** "[exact text]"
- **Proposed:** "[fix]"
- **Category / Severity:** [Category] / [High|Medium|Low]
```

---

### 3.4 `audit [file.pptx]`

Visual layout audit via image conversion. Read-only report.

```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp FILE.pptx
pdftoppm -png -r 200 /tmp/FILE.pdf /tmp/audit-slide
```

**Per-slide visual checklist:**
- [ ] No text overflow at any edge
- [ ] No element overlap (text on text, text on image, shape on shape)
- [ ] All text legible (â‰¥10pt equivalent)
- [ ] Tables and formulas fit within content area
- [ ] Consistent font sizes across similar slide types
- [ ] Adequate contrast between text and background
- [ ] No visual clutter (too many competing elements)
- [ ] Accent cards â‰¤ 2 per slide
- [ ] Layout diversity (no 3+ consecutive same type)

**Via parallel subagents**: dispatch parallel agents, each assigned 3-5 slides. Each agent reads its slides one at a time via an image/file reader and returns a text-only report. Never read slide images in the main conversation â€” images accumulate in context and exceed the 20MB limit after ~7 slides.

Report per issue with slide number, description, severity, and fix recommendation.

---

### 3.5 `pedagogy [file.pptx]`

Pedagogical review. Read-only report.

**13 teaching patterns to validate:**

| # | Pattern | Red Flag |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | Motivation before formalism | Definition without context |
| 2 | Incremental notation introduction | 5+ new symbols on one slide |
| 3 | Concrete examples after definitions | 2 consecutive definitions, no example |
| 4 | Progressive complexity | Advanced concept before prerequisite |
| 5 | Fragment reveal (problem â†’ solution) | Dense theorem revealed all at once |
| 6 | Signpost slides at pivots | Abrupt topic jump, no transition |
| 7 | Two-slide strategy for dense theorems | Complex theorem crammed in 1 slide |
| 8 | Semantic color usage | Binary contrasts in same color |
| 9 | Card/box hierarchy | Wrong accent type for content |
| 10 | Card fatigue avoidance | 3+ accent cards on one slide |
| 11 | Socratic embedding | Zero questions in entire deck |
| 12 | Visual-first for complex concepts | Notation before visualization |
| 13 | Side-by-side comparison | Sequential slides for related definitions |

**Deck-level checks:**
- Narrative arc (motivation â†’ build-up â†’ climax â†’ resolution)
- Pacing (max 3-4 theory-heavy slides before example or visual break)
- Visual rhythm (section dividers every 5-8 slides)
- Notation consistency throughout
- Student prerequisite assumptions reasonable

---

### 3.6 `excellence [file.pptx]`

Comprehensive multi-dimensional review. **Dispatch 5 parallel Agent calls.**

1. **Visual audit agent** â€” dispatch parallel subagents, each assigned 3-5 slides. Each agent reads its slide images ONE at a time via an image/file reader, checks for overlap, font consistency, card fatigue, spacing issues, layout diversity, content density. Returns text-only report per slide with severity. Never read slide images in the main conversation.

2. **Pedagogy review agent** â€” "Extract text from the .pptx. Validate 13 pedagogical patterns and deck-level checks (narrative arc, pacing, visual rhythm, notation consistency). Report pattern-by-pattern."

3. **Proofreading agent** â€” "Extract text from the .pptx. Check grammar, spelling, citation consistency, notation consistency, academic quality. Report per issue with location and fix."

4. **Formula quality agent** â€” dispatch subagents to check formula slide images (3-5 slides per agent, one image per read call). Check: DPI adequate (not blurry), color matches slide theme, alignment correct, sizing consistent. Returns text-only report.

5. **Domain review agent** (optional â€” enabled with `--domain` flag or when paper is math/theory-heavy) â€” "Verify substantive correctness: assumptions stated, derivations valid, citation fidelity, claims supported. Report per issue with severity."

**After all agents return**, synthesize a combined report:

```markdown
# Excellence Review: [Filename]

## Overall Quality: [EXCELLENT / GOOD / NEEDS WORK / POOR]

| Dimension | Critical | Major | Minor |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| Visual/Layout | | | |
| Pedagogical | | | |
| Proofreading | | | |
| Formula Quality | | | |
| Domain (if run) | | | |

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)
### Major Issues (Next Revision)
### Recommended Next Steps
```

Quality score mapping: Excellent (0-2 critical, 0-5 major), Good (3-5 critical, 6-15 major), Needs Work (6-10 critical, 16-30 major), Poor (11+ critical, 31+ major).

---

### 3.7 `visual-check [file.pptx]`

PDF â†’ image systematic visual review.

**Workflow:**

1. Convert:
   ```bash
python <skill-dir>/scripts/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp FILE.pptx
   pdftoppm -png -r 200 /tmp/FILE.pdf /tmp/vc-slide
   ```

2. Dispatch parallel subagents for visual inspection, each assigned 3-5 slides. Each agent reads its slides one at a time via an image/file reader, runs the per-slide checklist, and returns a **text-only** report. **Never read slide images in the main conversation** â€” images accumulate in context and exceed 20MB after ~7 slides. Systematic per-slide checklist:
   - [ ] No text overflow at any edge (top, bottom, left, right)
   - [ ] No element overlap
   - [ ] All text legible at presentation distance
   - [ ] Formula images crisp (not blurry/pixelated)
   - [ ] Tables fit within slide width, cell math rendered as OMML
   - [ ] Long table continuations have repeated headers and "(cont'd)" title
   - [ ] Consistent font sizes across similar slides
   - [ ] Adequate text-background contrast
   - [ ] No visual clutter
   - [ ] Theme colors applied consistently
   - [ ] Content density adequate (text fills >50% of card/region area)

3. Report per issue:
   ```
   ### Slide N: [slide title]
   - **Issue:** [description]
   - **Severity:** Critical / Major / Minor
   - **Fix:** [specific recommendation]
   ```

---

### 3.8 `extract-figures [file.pdf] [pages]`

Extract figures from a paper PDF for use in slides. **MCP extraction first, pdftoppm fallback.**

1. Identify target figures â€” use `pdf_get_toc` / `pdf_read_pages` to locate. If unsure, ask user.
2. **Try MCP extraction** (primary path):
   ```
   mcp__pdf-mcp__pdf_extract_images(path=PDF_PATH, pages=PAGES, output_dir="diagrams")
   ```
   - Saves images directly to `diagrams/` as PNG files (original resolution, zero token cost).
   - Returns `{page, index, width, height, format, file_path}` â€” use `file_path` directly.
   - For each target page, pick the largest image (or let user choose if multiple).
   - Rename to descriptive name if needed: `mv diagrams/page3_img0.png diagrams/<id>.png`
3. **Fallback to pdftoppm** â€” use when MCP returns no images, or when page-region cropping is needed:
   - Write `diagrams.json` with `type: "extract"` entries (include `crop` coordinates if needed).
   - Run renderer:
     ```bash
     python <skill-dir>/scripts/render_diagrams.py diagrams.json diagrams/
     ```
4. Update or create `diagrams/manifest.json` with extracted image metadata.

**Rules:**
- Must attribute source (`Source: Author et al., Year`) unless it's the user's own paper
- Resolution check: <800px in any dimension â†’ warn user about projection blur
- Never extract tables â€” rebuild with `addTable()` for crisp rendering
- Multi-figure pages: MCP may return separate image objects per figure; if fused into one image, use pdftoppm + `crop`

### 3.9 `validate [file.pptx] [duration]`

Automated quantitative validation. Checks measurable properties.

**Checks:**

1. **Slide count vs duration** (if duration provided):
   ```bash
   python <skill-dir>/scripts/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp FILE.pptx
   pdfinfo /tmp/FILE.pdf | grep "Pages:"
   ```
   Compare against timing table. Flag if outside range.

2. **File size**:
   - \>50 MB: warning (slow to share)
   - \>100 MB: critical (likely uncompressed images)

3. **Content extraction**:
   ```bash
   markitdown FILE.pptx > content.md
   ```
   - Count slides with no text â†’ flag empty slides
   - Check for placeholder text (`[TODO]`, `[XXX]`)

4. **Formula images** (if `formulas/` directory exists):
   - All manifest entries have files that exist
   - No manifest entries with `"error"` field
   - Image dimensions reasonable (width > 100px)

**Report format:**
```
# Validation Report: [Filename]

| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Slide count | N slides / Xmin | OK / WARNING |
| File size | X.X MB | OK / WARNING |
| Empty slides | N found | OK / WARNING |
| Placeholder text | N found | OK / CRITICAL |
| Formula images | N/M valid | OK / WARNING |

Overall: PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL
```

---

## 4. Verification Protocol

**Every task ends with verification.** Non-negotiable.

```
[ ] JS script executes without errors (node exit code 0)
[ ] .pptx file generated and non-empty (>10KB)
[ ] soffice converts to PDF successfully
[ ] Slide images visually inspected (at least spot-check 3-5 slides)
[ ] Text content verified via markitdown (no garbled text, placeholders)
[ ] Score â‰¥ 90 (for create action) or issues documented (for review actions)
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Cannot find module 'pptxgenjs'` | Run the project's dependency setup path or ask for approval before installing `pptxgenjs` |
| Formula images missing / manifest errors | Check LaTeX syntax in `formulas.json` (double-escape `\\`), re-run `render_latex.py`. Fallback: plain text |
| soffice hangs or fails | `pkill -f soffice`, retry with `--headless` flag |
| Colors wrong in .pptx | Remove `#` prefix from hex. Use 6-char hex only. Transparency via `transparency` property |
| Shapes misaligned after multiple adds | Use factory functions â€” PptxGenJS mutates option objects in-place |
| `dot: command not found` | Install Graphviz through the project's approved setup path |
| Diagram has default blue/black colors | Pass `--theme` flag to `render_diagrams.py` matching slide theme |
| Extracted figure blurry | Source PDF may be low-res; try higher DPI or find vector source |
| `pdfinfo: command not found` | Install Poppler through the project's approved setup path; it provides `pdfinfo` and `pdftoppm` |

---

## 6. Dependencies

Do not install dependencies implicitly from this skill. Verify they are already available, or use the project's documented setup path with explicit approval.

**Node.js**: `pptxgenjs`
**Python**: Pillow, lxml, markitdown with PPTX support
**System**: `node`, `pandoc` (OMML conversion), `xelatex`, `pdfcrop`, `pdftoppm` (Poppler), `soffice` (LibreOffice), `pdfinfo` (Poppler), `dot`/`neato`/`fdp`/`circo` (Graphviz allowlist), `mmdc` (Mermaid CLI, optional)
